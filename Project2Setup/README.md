## Getting Started

SEE BELOW or details: SUBMIT THE 'submit' folder to Web-CAT, not the full project.

Welcome to the VS Code Java for ITSC2214.

## Project 2

This setup project gives you the starting files for Project 2 for the Fall 2024 ITSC 2214 course.


## Submit to Web-CAT

To submit the project to Web-CAT, select the Web-CAT icon on the left bar and follow the prompts. Submit the folder named `submit` from your project.


## Folder Structure

The project contains these folders by default:

- `submit`: the folder to store the source code (i.e., *.java) that you have to submit to web-cat, hence the name.
- `src`: additional source files could go here, not to be submitted to Web-CAT
- `misc`: other source files that don't have to be submitted to Web-CAT
- `.vscode` stores settings, you shouldn't have to touch it.
- `lib`: the folder for libraries (i.e., *.jar files)
- `bin`: the folder where the compiled output files will be stored (typically class files)

## Data
The txt files included are used in the Project2 main program for example only. You do not need to submit them to web-cat.
