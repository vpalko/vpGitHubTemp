     * In this method you should play your melody so that it can 
     * be heard on the computer's speakers. Essentially this 
     * consists of calling the play method on each Note in your 
     * array. The notes should be played from the beginning
     * of the list to the end, unless there are notes that 
     * are marked as being part of a repeated section. If a 
     * series of notes represents a repeated section, that sequence 
     * is played twice. For example, in the diagram below, suppose 
     * the notes at indexes 3, 5, 9, and 12 all indicate that they 
     * are start/end points of repeated sections (their isRepeat
     * method returns true). In this case, the correct sequence of 
     * note indexes to play is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 
     * 9,10, 11, 12, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Note that notes at indexes 
     * 3-5 and 9-12 are played twice in our example.
     * This method should not modify the state of your array. 
     * Also, it should be possible to call play multiple times 
     * and get the same result each time.
