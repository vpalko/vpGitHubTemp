## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java for ITSC2214. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code. Think of each `project` as the folder that contains all of the materials for each class project. You could even have a separate project for exploration to try out ideas or play with code from lectures.

You should start all new projects from a clean copy of a project. Download one from [(https://webpages.charlotte.edu/mperez19/ProjectTemplate.zip](https://webpages.charlotte.edu/mperez19/ProjectTemplate.zip).  Expand that file in your file system, change the name of the top folder, and then open it in VS Code via **File > Open...**

## Folder Structure

The project contains these folders by default:

- `submit`: the folder to store the source code (i.e., *.java) that you have to submit to web-cat, hence the name.
- `misc`: other source files that don't have to be submitted to Web-CAT
- `.vscode` stores settings, you shouldn't have to touch it.
- `lib`: the folder for libraries (i.e., *.jar files)
- `bin`: the folder where the compiled output files will be stored (typically class files)

Put all of your code in the `src` folder.

## Submit to Web-CAT

To submit the project to Web-CAT, select the Web-CAT icon on the left bar and follow the prompts. Submit the `submit` folder from your project.
